Simulated the evolution of temperature with time in the inner, outer and middle wraps of stainless steel coil during annealing inside the bell furnace (batch annealing furnace). Worked on [Computational](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqvwMROEhjGB_dNAiSFopnOBkpY7Onjx/view?usp=sharing) and [Mathematical](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7APFf3SHvqWG5zamfsxxDzEp70hK_Ct/view?usp=sharing) modeling of heating of Stainless Steel(SS) coil.
